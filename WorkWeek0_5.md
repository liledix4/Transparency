# liledix4 Transparency – Work Week 0.5

*<sup>12-15 September 2024</sup>*

The easiest way to track progress without waiting for the next report dropping – [2do project!](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15/views/3) It's updated in real time!

However, If you prefer the weekly digest, keep reading.

## What's the deal with the Work Weeks? Why 0.5?

## More transparency. I'm more open now

## Refreshed 2do project!

## YouTube posts

## Concrete plan

## About commissions: it's more clear now

## Some music plugins were in trouble

## Licenses. Figured them out!

There's a new public repository, LICENSE – you can check it out!

Licenses were an ongoing concern since the beginning of WIP 1.0 of Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers project. However, it took me just two days to choose three most suitable licenses for the open-source code among countless variants – and in my opinion, the choice is pretty good.

In case of audiovisual content (music also counts), there is some long story. For a long time, I knew about Creative Commons. My most favorite variant was BY-NC-SA – it means that commercial use is forbidden, and if you remix/remake, you must use the same license. Too restrictive? Yes. That's why I liked it. However, it was a long time ago and I didn't really bother with the licenses after that. Starting from this week, I'm making changes. Licenses will be important again, and this time I use another type of Creative Commons license you'll love – just BY. Meaning that I allow commercial use and it won't be necessary to use the same license if you modify my content. But license requires giving credit. Be nice. However, there is a thing. I can't use CC BY if my content is a remix or just fanmade in general, since originally this is a property of some franchises and other authors – therefore, my fanmade content is officially unlicensed (this time I'm saying it explicitly) – meaning that you can do whatever you want with it, but you have no guarantees that it's safe to use.

For the Work Week 1 or later, I'm planning to write some terms of use. This week, there was an unusual situation with the project called Plant Defenders, and I'm expecting more unusual things to come later, so I should make things prepared to any surprises.

Also I'm creating a repository called Content-Removal, in case if some copyright holders won't like that some content is public. Guys, yes, you can use YouTube tools to remove content, but I'm offering cooperation for removing content on some other places. I can't entirely stop content from spreading if people consider it valuable (they're doing it at their own risk, it's not completely fair for me to take the whole responsibility), but removing initial source is the first step. Simply contact me, one email, and the content will be removed.

## Stats

These numbers are the sum of the values across all projects – including those not publicly available.

| Title                 | Value         |
| :-------------------- | ------------: |
| Lines of text added   | `+0`          |
| Lines of text removed | `-0`          |

[The term “lines of code” is controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Measurement_methods), so “lines of text” is used instead.

The count is done by summing up the numbers from all Git repositories on my computer.
