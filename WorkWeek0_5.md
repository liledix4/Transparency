# liledix4 Transparency ‚Äì Work Week 0.5

*<sup>12-15 September 2024</sup>*

The easiest way to track progress without waiting for the next report dropping ‚Äì [2do project!](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15/views/3) It's updated in real time!

However, If you prefer the weekly digest, keep reading.

## What's the deal with the Work Weeks? Why 0.5?

The idea of Work Weeks was introduced in August 2024. At that moment, it was experimental, so the first week was called Work Week 0. Some problems caused to take a break and continue the work without counting Weeks, and Work Week 1 didn't happen. After that break, it was decided that before proper Work Week 1 begins, Work Week 0 will be extended. That's why there's Work Week 0.5. It's still experimental, but it addresses the problems of Week 0.

The reason why Work Weeks exist is simple. It makes possible to see progress over time, no matter what the project is ‚Äì and weekly updates are the most optimal.

## More transparency. I'm more open now

There was a huge problem for a very long time. I didn't know how to find a balance between two things: the great complexity of what I was doing, and letting people know at least how great it was. Now that I'm coming up with some helpful ideas, finding this balance is getting easier.

I can't reveal many things, and in these cases I'm writing `REDACTED`, adding some gibberish letters and numbers only I can understand. üòù But overall, now I'm telling you more than I ever did. Still a lot of secrets, but at least you see that something is cooking, every day.

If there are some tasks related to your requests, and if they're secret for the public eye, you'll have no trouble understanding the sequence of all the other tasks leading to your requests. Thanks to the refreshed 2do project!

Oh, and since you can see what I'm busy with, I'm responding to DMs much more actively!

## Refreshed 2do project!

GitHub has a thing called projects. Project is a place for your tasks. You can add some special information to the tasks, and depending on that info, you can change the look and behavior of the task list, so that it shows tasks in a way you find comfortable and simple to understand. You can display tasks in three forms: as a table, as the vertical boards (scrolled horizontally), and as a timeline (it's called roadmap).

I have only one project on GitHub, and it's common for all types of tasks. I call this project 2do. Why? There are two reasons. First of all, most obvious, it reads as "to-do". Second reason is not so obvious: quite a long time ago, I had a different nickname, 3do, so I'm using 2do as a tribute. Moreover, I've created a special file extension `.2do` for task lists ‚Äì files with this extension are just Markdown files, but some programs and apps may have a special use for them (for example, a project manager may parse `.2do` files to track progress and show the list of offline/private/shareable issues). Regularly I use Windows program called Everything to filter folders containing `.2do` files instantly.

So, this week, I made some improvements for 2do project, so it can be easier for you to understand the progress that is happening in real time. This time, 2do project is getting some types of tasks I didn't add before.

## About commissions: it's more clear now

I won't stop praising 2do project, okay? This is the main thing I've built everything around. So I'll sell it as much as I want. üòÑ

Now, commissions will appear on 2do. Commission task will be `REDACTED` unless the person asks to keep things revealed.

But putting 2do aside: there are more clear terms for commissions! Also, the price list! And in Work Week 1, it's planned to update YouTube Membership for new pre-orders!

And I know. I know. I know. When will the commissions open again? See the next section!

## Concrete plan

## Some music plugins were in trouble

## Licenses. Figured them out!

There's a new public repository, LICENSE ‚Äì you can check it out!

Licenses were an ongoing concern since the beginning of WIP 1.0 of Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers project. However, it took me just two days to choose three most suitable licenses for the open-source code among countless variants ‚Äì and in my opinion, the choice is pretty good.

In case of audiovisual content (music also counts), there is some long story. For a long time, I knew about Creative Commons. My most favorite variant was BY-NC-SA ‚Äì it means that commercial use is forbidden, and if you remix/remake, you must use the same license. Too restrictive? Yes. That's why I liked it. However, it was a long time ago and I didn't really bother with the licenses after that. Starting from this week, I'm making changes. Licenses will be important again, and this time I use another type of Creative Commons license you'll love ‚Äì just BY. Meaning that I allow commercial use and it won't be necessary to use the same license if you modify my content. But license requires giving credit. Be nice. However, there is a thing. I can't use CC BY if my content is a remix or just fanmade in general, since originally this is a property of some franchises and other authors ‚Äì therefore, my fanmade content is officially unlicensed (this time I'm saying it explicitly) ‚Äì meaning that you can do whatever you want with it, but you have no guarantees that it's safe to use.

For the Work Week 1 or later, I'm planning to write some terms of use. This week, there was an unusual situation with the project called Plant Defenders, and I'm expecting more unusual things to come later, so I should make things prepared to any surprises.

Also I'm creating a repository called Content-Removal, in case if some copyright holders won't like that some content is public. Guys, yes, you can use YouTube tools to remove content, but I'm offering cooperation for removing content on some other places. I can't entirely stop content from spreading if people consider it valuable (they're doing it at their own risk, it's not completely fair for me to take the whole responsibility), but removing initial source is the first step. Simply contact me, one email, and the content will be removed.

## P4P!

I'd like to introduce a model I call P4P. It's short for "project for project".

In Week 1 or 2, you'll see what I mean. But there's no secret, I can tell about it here.

For a long time, I was thinking about advertising other projects with my effort, and in exchange I'd promote something of my own. It was a thing during PvZ Road Trip.

With P4P, I'd like to bring the concept to the next level. There's a new situation, I have a big project Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers. I can mention various other projects and individual authors on the BvS website, also I can provide special content for them ‚Äì but I would ask others to support BvS, spread the word about it, and probably some collaborations may be possible. Ideally, this campaign should be regular, it's not one-off. And everybody wins ‚Äì if BvS gets attention, it's better for other projects too from the advertisement standpoint.

## F social media!

In my new repository HowTo, you may find some pieces of code that help to remove likes on Twitter, YouTube, and so on.

So, I used those pieces of code to remove all likes and subscriptions from Twitter, GitHub, Reddit and YouTube (kept subscriptions there). It took some effort (1800+ likes on Twitter, now gone), but I did it.

The thing that motivated me to write that stuff on HowTo is: my frustration with the social media. I hate the concept of likes, subscriptions and saving content online ‚Äì mainly because **companies and corporations don't give you the tools for managing that data however YOU need**. You don't own your likes, you can't automate them, you can't extract specific liked posts based on your criteria. Social media forces you to add a like and **forget about it**, so that they could tune the algorithms better for you ‚Äì but that's a piece of your personal data you give to the corporation, they can do with it whatever they want, up to building a profile about you specifically so the advertisers (and potentially hackers) would feel happier. They *can* automate your likes, but you *can't*. What's the point of liking things in this case, if the links can be saved locally? (the thing I'm achieving with the project called Bookmarker) That's where my truly favorite stuff really should belong ‚Äì my own PC, I own those likes, I can automate them however I want, and I don't see anything potentially valuable lost because of that. And if something unfortunate happens to the service, at least I'll have the descriptions of what I saved, for nostalgic purposes probably. In a long term, you don't know why you need likes and subscriptions, you lose the purpose ‚Äì if the algorithm stops showing the channel you subscribed to, that subscription you have means nothing, and you won't even remember it.

## Stats

These numbers are the sum of the values across all projects ‚Äì including those not publicly available.

| Title                 | Value         |
| :-------------------- | ------------: |
| Lines of text added   | `+0`          |
| Lines of text removed | `-0`          |

[The term ‚Äúlines of code‚Äù is controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Measurement_methods), so ‚Äúlines of text‚Äù is used instead.

The count is done by summing up the numbers from all Git repositories on my computer.
