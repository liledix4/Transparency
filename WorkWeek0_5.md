# liledix4 Transparency – Work Week 0.5

*<sup>12-15 September 2024</sup>*

The easiest way to track progress without waiting for the next report dropping – [2do project!](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15/views/3) It's updated in real time!

However, If you prefer the weekly digest, keep reading.

## What's the deal with the Work Weeks? Why 0.5?

The idea of Work Weeks was introduced in August 2024. At that moment, it was experimental, so the first week was called Work Week 0. Some problems caused to take a break and continue the work without counting Weeks, and Work Week 1 didn't happen. After that break, it was decided that before proper Work Week 1 begins, Work Week 0 will be extended. That's why there's Work Week 0.5. It's still experimental, but it addresses the problems of Week 0.

The reason why Work Weeks exist is simple. It makes possible to see progress over time, no matter what the project is – and weekly updates are the most optimal.

## More transparency. I'm more open now

There was a huge problem for a very long time. I didn't know how to find a balance between two things: the great complexity of what I was doing, and letting people know at least how great it was. Now that I'm coming up with some helpful ideas, finding this balance is getting easier.

I can't reveal many things, and in these cases I'm writing `REDACTED`, adding some gibberish letters and numbers only I can understand. 😝 But overall, now I'm telling you more than I ever did. Still a lot of secrets, but at least you see that something is cooking, every day.

If there are some tasks related to your requests, and if they're secret for the public eye, you'll have no trouble understanding the sequence of all the other tasks leading to your requests. Thanks to the refreshed 2do project!

Oh, and since you can see what I'm busy with, I'm responding to DMs much more actively!

## Refreshed 2do project!

GitHub has a thing called projects. Project is a place for your tasks. You can add some special information to the tasks, and depending on that info, you can change the look and behavior of the task list, so that it shows tasks in a way you find comfortable and simple to understand. You can display tasks in three forms: as a table, as the vertical boards (scrolled horizontally), and as a timeline (it's called roadmap).

I have only one project on GitHub, and it's common for all types of tasks. I call this project 2do. Why? There are two reasons. First of all, most obvious, it reads as "to-do". Second reason is not so obvious: quite a long time ago, I had a different nickname, 3do, so I'm using 2do as a tribute. Moreover, I've created a special file extension `.2do` for task lists – files with this extension are just Markdown files, but some programs and apps may have a special use for them (for example, a project manager may parse `.2do` files to track progress and show the list of offline/private/shareable issues). Regularly I use Windows program called Everything to filter folders containing `.2do` files instantly.

So, this week, I made some improvements for 2do project, so it can be easier for you to understand the progress that is happening in real time. This time, 2do project is getting some types of tasks I didn't add before.

There are two permanent links for 2do project:

## Refreshed GitHub account

Many unneeded repositories have been deleted, many other repositories have been changed/merged/migrated, and a number of new repositories have been created.

And the changes are still ongoing! I have many projects on my computer that could become public repositories eventually, and it takes time to review them all. Ideally, I'd love **EVERY** project of mine to be available via GitHub, privately or publicly. Because sharing is caring!

## About commissions: it's more clear now

I won't stop praising 2do project, okay? This is the main thing I've built everything around. So I'll sell it as much as I want. 😄

Now, commissions will appear on 2do. Commission task will be `REDACTED` unless the person asks to keep things revealed.

But putting 2do aside: there are more clear terms for commissions! Also, the price list! And in Work Week 1, it's planned to update YouTube Membership for new pre-orders!

And I know. I know. I know. When will the commissions open again? See the next section!

## Concrete plan

I've created some posts on my YouTube channel's Community tab. There I addressed some issues, and I'll repeat it here.

New plan sounds like this:

> 1. Some preparations (boring routine stuff, don't mind it).
> 2. BvS content release.
> 3. Asking people to help with BvS WIP 2 while I'm preparing things for WIP 1.5. Also, asking some people to spread the word about BvS, maybe it could help – I'll give enough info to make it happen.
> 4. Figuring out what to do with the fan content (like remixes and covers).
> 5. Commissions! Plus figuring out how to keep the channel active with regular releases without affecting BvS content.
> 6. We work on BvS WIP 2 🎉

Now, what does everything mean? Let's find out.

Preparations. I'm reporting about them in this Transparency repository.

BvS content release. I'm doing something big and serious. Upcoming content consists of 4 parts: script, music, video, and website. Progress can be tracked on 2do project.

BvS has development stages. Every stage is called WIP ("work in progress"), and every WIP has a number. Before going to the next stage, a ton of work is being done. Starting from October 2023, the development stage was WIP 1 for several months. Various situations happened during WIP 1 (that is now retrospectively called WIP 1.0), and starting from July 2024, the work on WIP 1.5 has begun, laying the groundwork for WIP 2 that is planned for October-November 2024. So:

- WIP 1.0: October 2023 – July 2024
- WIP 1.5: July-October 2024
- WIP 2: planned to start in October or November 2024

As a part of the process of moving to WIP 2, it's planned to ask some people to help with the project – but before it happens, I need to finish my introduction content that is a part of WIP 1.5.

Another change that happened to BvS is that Violet Velvet Vivacity (team behind the project PvZ World Tour in 2020, now canceled) is no longer the main parent of this project – instead, BvS is being developed by BvS Team and independent contributors (in case if Violet Velvet Vivacity revives, it can contribute to BvS independently too).

Now, item number 4 on the list. There is a serious problem, the content is conflicting between BvS and YouTube channel. This problem was existing for months. I want to have a serious discussion with everyone and hear all opinions. But there's more: this problem is serious to the point that I'm questioning commissions.

Over the years, my relationship with the YouTube channel was changing. Since 2024, I don't consider it my main place for putting creative effort – instead, it's BvS, because of the multifaceted nature of content, it's not just music, it's coding, it's writing, it's design, and more-more-more. YouTube channel is restrictive: it's only music, and only specific music that works for the audience. BvS allows far more creative freedom, and I'd like to be valued for making the choice prioritizing the broader creativity.

However! Would I like to keep the channel alive? Of course and most certainly yes. But I'll tell the problem itself. In this paragraph, you need to keep some points in mind. YouTube channel is just music, and BvS is my primary focus. YouTube channel has some popularity, BvS very unfortunately doesn't have and can't gain (yet). The problem is strictly about music, nothing else. BvS is a massive project and it's planned to have a huge soundtrack where I put my best ideas, you already have some glimpses of those and there'll be more of them. But, I'm known for including original ideas to the fanmade tracks for YouTube channel like remixes. How can I add ideas to the fanmade tracks in a way that they won't interfere with the ideas for BvS? I mean, it's kinda fine to remaster or transcribe stuff without including something original – I can very easily remake Rigor Mormist from PvZ1, or Ohayou Sayori from DDLC, I'm okay with that. But if people want original bits, or if I myself want to add original bits to the fanmade stuff – that's where the problems begin.

Add commissions to the mix, and the whole situation will become even more concerning.

I think I need some reviewers who would check everything before public release, maybe it could help to solve the problem.

That's all I wanted to say.

## Licenses. Figured them out!

There's a new public repository, [LICENSE](https://github.com/liledix4/LICENSE) – you can check it out!

Licenses were an ongoing concern since the beginning of WIP 1.0 of Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers project. However, it took me just two days to choose three most suitable licenses for the open-source code among countless variants – and in my opinion, the choice is pretty good.

In case of audiovisual content (music also counts), there is some long story. For a long time, I knew about Creative Commons. My most favorite variant was BY-NC-SA – it means that commercial use is forbidden, and if you remix/remake, you must use the same license. Too restrictive? Yes. That's why I liked it. However, it was a long time ago and I didn't really bother with the licenses after that. Starting from this week, I'm making changes. Licenses will be important again, and this time I use another type of Creative Commons license you'll love – just BY. Meaning that I allow commercial use and it won't be necessary to use the same license if you modify my content. But license requires giving credit. Be nice. However, there is a thing. I can't use CC BY if my content is a remix or just fanmade in general, since originally this is a property of some franchises and other authors – therefore, my fanmade content is officially unlicensed (this time I'm saying it explicitly) – meaning that you can do whatever you want with it, but you have no guarantees that it's safe to use.

For the Work Week 1 or later, I'm planning to write some terms of use. This week, there was an unusual situation with the project called Plant Defenders, and I'm expecting more unusual things to come later, so I should make things prepared to any surprises.

Also I'm creating a repository called Content-Removal, in case if some copyright holders won't like that some content is public. Guys, yes, you can use YouTube tools to remove content, but I'm offering cooperation for removing content on some other places. I can't entirely stop content from spreading if people consider it valuable (they're doing it at their own risk, it's not completely fair for me to take the whole responsibility), but removing initial source is the first step. Simply contact me, one email, and the content will be removed.

## P4P!

I'd like to introduce a model I call P4P. It's short for "project for project".

In Week 1 or 2, you'll see what I mean. But there's no secret, I can tell about it here.

For a long time, I was thinking about advertising other projects with my effort, and in exchange I'd promote something of my own. It was a thing during PvZ Road Trip.

With P4P, I'd like to bring the concept to the next level. There's a new situation, I have a big project Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers. I can mention various other projects and individual authors on the BvS website, also I can provide special content for them – but I would ask others to support BvS, spread the word about it, and probably some collaborations may be possible. Ideally, this campaign should be regular, it's not one-off. And everybody wins – if BvS gets attention, it's better for other projects too from the advertisement standpoint.

Because BvS and my YouTube channel are two separate projects, that's where P4P works. My YT channel advertises BvS, and BvS advertises my YT channel, with special integration like "every commission and donation on my YT channel helps to improve BvS".

## F social media!

In my new repository [HowTo](https://github.com/liledix4/HowTo), you may find some pieces of code that help to remove likes on Twitter, YouTube, and so on.

So, I used those pieces of code to remove all likes and subscriptions from Twitter, GitHub, Reddit and YouTube (kept subscriptions there). It took some effort (1800+ likes on Twitter, now gone), but I did it.

The thing that motivated me to write that stuff on HowTo is: my frustration with the social media. I hate the concept of likes, subscriptions and saving content online – mainly because **companies and corporations don't give you the tools for managing that data however YOU need**. You don't own your likes, you can't automate them, you can't extract specific liked posts based on your criteria. Social media forces you to add a like and **forget about it**, so that they could tune the algorithms better for you – but that's a piece of your personal data you give to the corporation, they can do with it whatever they want, up to building a profile about you specifically so the advertisers (and potentially hackers) would feel happier. They *can* automate your likes, but you *can't*. What's the point of liking things in this case, if the links can be saved locally? (the thing I'm achieving with the project called Bookmarker) That's where my truly favorite stuff really should belong – my own PC, I own those likes, I can automate them however I want, and I don't see anything potentially valuable lost because of that. And if something unfortunate happens to the service, at least I'll have the descriptions of what I saved, for nostalgic purposes probably. In a long term, you don't know why you need likes and subscriptions, you lose the purpose – if the algorithm stops showing the channel you subscribed to, that subscription you have means nothing, and you won't even remember it.

## Video format was planned for Transparency reports – but this idea was quickly scrapped

## Stats

These numbers are the sum of the values across all projects – including those not publicly available.

| Title                 | Value         |
| :-------------------- | ------------: |
| Lines of text added   | `+0`          |
| Lines of text removed | `-0`          |

[The term “lines of code” is controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Measurement_methods), so “lines of text” is used instead.

The count is done by summing up the numbers from all Git repositories on my computer.
