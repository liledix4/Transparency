# liledix4 Transparency ‚Äì Work Week 1

*<sup>16-22 September 2024</sup>*

The easiest way to track progress without waiting for the next report dropping ‚Äì [2do project!](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15/views/3) It's updated in real time!

However, If you prefer the weekly digest, keep reading.

## What's going on with DDLC New Heading? (the mod for Doki Doki Literature Club!)

Well, revival!

Listen to this snippet of the brand new soundtrack! Personally, it's amazing and I love it very much.

Well. The idea of reviving New Heading is not new. I had it in my mind for years! However, this mod won't be revived yet. First of all, I need to know if enough people are interested in it ‚Äì it's not BvS, I can't revive this project solely with my wish.

1. My offer: this mod can happen! Thoughts?
2. Waiting for feedback.
3. If there's not enough feedback, I'll try a few other ways to draw attention.
4. If people would love DDLC:NH to be released, then good! If not, well, tough luck, seems like.

New DDLC:NH is planned for 2025.

Additionally, new DDLC:NH will start as the open-source project! [See this repository.](https://github.com/lilFM/DDLCNH) lilFM is my secondary place on GitHub where I upload strictly fanmade content, to keep the main GitHub account clean and to make repositories more collab-friendly.

## Massive change on my PC

This Work Week isn't fruitful in terms of public content. But you can't say that I did nothing, right? üôÉ

I'm preparing my PC for a rapid fire of releases! As a part of the Transparency project, I've connected EVERY folder on my Desktop to the GitHub repositories! Every single folder now has the corresponding repository, which means that the previously private content will become public eventually!

Compared to the music, it's not that interesting, but you need to know what I'm invested in.

It takes time to adapt every project to the public release, so Work Week 2 will be busy, and I'm not sure if updates will be shown on 2do project.

## Plenty of new repositories

Related to the previous segment of this document. You may notice in my GitHub account that I've created many repositories at once. If I start mentioning them here, it'll be a long list. If you're interested, you can see for yourself. Repositories are empty, because I've created them to connect local folders on my PC for eventual uploads.

## My private Bookmarker database is updated massively

It's not interesting for you at all. But I should mention it. Because I've spent a lot of time to do it.

Bookmarker is my planned note-taking application that respects privacy. Database normally consists of the Markdown files, each with a single list of URLs, tags and notes.

There's no working app yet, but I'm already preparing my saved data for proper parsing. I saved dozens of thousands of URLs, and all of them need to be reordered manually before trusting the automated process. Manual process is not finished yet, but this week I've made a massive work already.

## Stats

These numbers are the sum of the values across all projects ‚Äì including those not publicly available.

| Title                 | Value         |
| :-------------------- | ------------: |
| Lines of text added   | `+0`          |
| Lines of text removed | `-0`          |

[The term ‚Äúlines of code‚Äù is controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Measurement_methods), so ‚Äúlines of text‚Äù is used instead.

The count is done by summing up the numbers from all Git repositories on my computer.
