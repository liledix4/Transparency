The easiest way to track progress without waiting for the next report dropping – [2do project!](https://github.com/users/liledix4/projects/15/views/3) It's updated in real time!

However, If you prefer the weekly digest, keep reading.

## What's going on with DDLC New Heading? (the mod for Doki Doki Literature Club!)

Well, revival!

Listen to this snippet of the brand new soundtrack! Personally, it's amazing and I love it very much.

Well. The idea of reviving New Heading is not new. I had it in my mind for years! However, this mod won't be revived yet. First of all, I need to know if enough people are interested in it – it's not BvS, I can't revive this project solely with my wish.

1. My offer: this mod can happen! Thoughts?
2. Waiting for feedback.
3. If there's not enough feedback, I'll try a few other ways to draw attention.
4. If people would love DDLC:NH to be released, then good! If not, well, tough luck, seems like.

New DDLC:NH is planned for 2025.

Additionally, new DDLC:NH will start as the open-source project! [See this repository.](https://github.com/lilFM/DDLCNH) lilFM is my secondary place on GitHub where I upload strictly fanmade content, to keep the main GitHub account clean and to make repositories more collab-friendly.

## New side projects

- [Config](https://github.com/liledix4/Config) – settings and configurations for various programs and apps, shared with love and caring!
- [WebEdits](https://github.com/liledix4/WebEdits) – visual modifications of websites, for the convenience.

## Stats

These numbers are the sum of the values across all projects – including those not publicly available.

| Title                 | Value         |
| :-------------------- | ------------: |
| Lines of text added   | `+0`          |
| Lines of text removed | `-0`          |

[The term “lines of code” is controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Measurement_methods), so “lines of text” is used instead.

The count is done by summing up the numbers from all Git repositories on my computer.
